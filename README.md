 College Placement Portal – Frontend (React)


The College Placement Portal is a web application designed to help students participate in campus placements smoothly. Students can register, log in, apply for jobs, get placement-related updates, access preparation material, and explore available training programs. Placement Officers can add, update, and manage job postings, and students receive notifications whenever a new job is added.


This frontend is built using **React (JSX, CSS)** and communicates with a **Spring Boot backend** using secure REST APIs.
